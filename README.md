# ParticleFire-NX
Proof of concept Nintendo Switch port of sorhanp's "particlefire-revision". It does nothing except look pretty and make a decent screensaver.

Installation:
Copy and download the .nro from the releases onto any folder on your Switch and run it via hbmenu (applet or app, either works!)

Build:
As long as you have DevKitPro set up with SDL2 and most GL graphics libraries, all you need to do is run "make -f Makefile.nx".

TODO: 
Clean up makefile.

Bugs:
You tell me.
